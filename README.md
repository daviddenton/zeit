====

A node.js clock and scheduler, intended to take place of the global v8 object for manipulation of time and scheduling of tasks which would be handled with calls to ```set/clearTimeout``` and ```set/clearInterval```. Zeit ships with a set of controllable Stub clocks which can be used for the manipulation of time and scheduling in tests.
